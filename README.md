# q-rl-marketing

_This has only been tested on OSX_

1. Download a release of Wave and have that running 

2. Create a python environment in the home app directory and install reqirements 
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app by pointing to the module directory
```bash
./venv/bin/python -m q_rl_marketing
```

4. Point your web browswer to localhost:55555

In the future, if you want to run this app you can skip step 2 as the environment is already set up
